## **Project Overview: Time Series Forecasting using LSTM, GRU, and ARIMA**

This project aims to **forecast time series data** using **deep learning (LSTM & GRU) and traditional statistical modeling (ARIMA)**. The workflow includes **data preprocessing, model training, forecasting, evaluation, and visualization**. The goal is to compare the accuracy and effectiveness of different time series forecasting models.

## **Summary of the Project**

### **1. Data Preprocessing**
- **Libraries Imported**: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow/Keras, Statsmodels, and pmdarima.
- **Feature Engineering**: The dataset is scaled using `MinMaxScaler` to normalize values.
- **Missing Value Handling**: Forward-fill and backward-fill techniques are applied.
- **Splitting the Data**: The dataset is split into **train, validation, and test sets** for model training.

### **2. Model Training**
- **LSTM Model**:
  - Two LSTM layers with 50 units each.
  - Fully connected layers with ReLU activation.
  - Optimized using **Adam optimizer** with Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss.
  
- **GRU Model**:
  - Similar architecture to LSTM, replacing LSTM layers with GRU layers.
  
- **ARIMA Model**:
  - Used for **traditional time series forecasting**.
  - The best `(p,d,q)` parameters are determined using `auto_arima`.

### **3. Forecasting**
- The best-trained **LSTM and GRU models** are loaded from saved `.h5` files.
- A **rolling window prediction** approach is used to forecast `n` future steps.
- ARIMA forecasts are generated using `.forecast(steps=n)`.

### **4. Visualization**
- **Actual vs. Predicted vs. Forecasted Values**
  - Interactive **Plotly visualizations** are used.
  - **Timestamps** are used instead of numerical indices.
- **Performance Evaluation Metrics**
  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
  - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
  - **R² Score (R-Squared Accuracy)**

## **5. Results & Performance**
| Model  | MAE  | RMSE  | R² Score  |
|--------|------|------|-----------|
| **LSTM** | 102.08 | 133.15 | 0.992 |
| **GRU**  | 92.08  | 119.14 | 0.991 |
| **ARIMA** | 1763.04 | 2064.85 | -2.2806 |

- **LSTM & GRU models show superior performance** compared to ARIMA.
- **ARIMA’s negative R² indicates poor fit**, suggesting it is not suitable for this dataset.
- **Further tuning** or combining models could improve forecasting accuracy.

## **6. How to Run the Project**
### **Installation of Dependencies**
To run this project, install the required dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **Running the Jupyter Notebook**
After installing dependencies, open the notebook using:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
Then run **Time_Series_Forecasting.ipynb** step by step.

## **Next Steps & Enhancements**

### **1. Hyperparameter Optimization**
- Use **GridSearchCV or Bayesian Optimization** to fine-tune:
  - Number of **LSTM/GRU units**
  - Batch size & epochs
  - Learning rate & optimizer selection

### **2. Seasonal Adjustments**
- ARIMA does not account for **seasonality** in the dataset.
- Use **SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)** or **Prophet** for better seasonal trend forecasting.

### **3. Feature Engineering**
- Add **exogenous features** like:
  - Hour, Day, Month encoding (for seasonality)
  - External weather conditions, economic indicators

### **4. Model Ensemble Techniques**
- Combine **LSTM, GRU, and ARIMA** into an **ensemble model**.
- Use **weighted averaging or stacking** to improve robustness.

### **5. Extend Forecasting Period**
- Increase `forecast_length = 100` to `5000+` points for long-term forecasting.
- Implement **recursive multi-step forecasting** to improve long-term accuracy.
